This is the repository for files to accompany the Geographical data and
parallel computing with R and Python workshop jointly offered by the Clark
Library, CSCAR, LSA IT, and ARC-TS.

These workshops will provide an overview of working with geospatial data and the steps necessary to turn a set of census data shapefiles into to a map viewable via a web browser. In addition, we will present an overview of parallel computing, and a demonstration of how to reduce execution time via parallel processing on the Flux cluster.  Examples will be shown using Python and R on separate days.  Each day will be self-contained.

This workshop is intended for those interested in an introduction to geospatial data analysis and/or to parallel computing. Familiarity with R, Python and similar software will help in understanding the workshop, but is not necessary to attend.

Accompanying files can be viewed [in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/clarkdatalabs/dotmap_workshop).
